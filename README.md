Working on a application that can predict student's score tests(posttest) by 
  * <b>School</b>
  * <b>School Setting</b>: Urban / Rural / Suburban
  * <b>School Type</b>: Public / Non-public
  * <b>Classroom</b>
  * <b>Teaching Method </b>: Standard / Experimental
  * <b>Number of Students</b>
  * <b>Gender</b>: Male / Female
  * <b>Lunch</b>: Qualified / Not qualified

## This repository contains
  * .csv file of the dataset file
  * .keynote of the project(mostly about the data analysis)
  * .ipynb file from Google Colab & Jupyter Notebook
<br>

## Beta Version Explanation

üëåüèª Okay and DONE:
  * Data Analysis of the dataset
  * used Linear Regression(scikit) to predict posttest scores without pretest in train data. ‚û°Ô∏è 95% score
  * Prototype of the application(UI)
  * conversion of model to CoreML(.mlmodel)

‚ùå NOT OKAY and need UPDATES:
  * The .ipynb files need to be organized(it may be hard to figure out the purpose of the code. :( This is my bad!!)
  * The model(scores.mlmodel) show wrong output if the combination of input datas are not from trained data => how should I fix?
  * The model inputs are extremely difficult to get their data as the DataFrame went through One-Hot-Encoding
